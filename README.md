Amount of all kinds of hacks related to blockchain are growing which made a lot of WEB3 startups consider doing external smart contract audits. They help to ensure that contracts are secure and operate as intended, protecting users assets from attackers. The demand for secure and transparent security solutions is at all-time high. This project aims to address the issue of security & transparency by implementing an audit report platform on FVM. 

This platform mission is to align resources in best way to make sure that the audit reports are stored on the Filecoin network after getting uploaded by the auditors for the projects requesting security check for their protocol or dApp.

The startups can:
- Start process of audit request by sharing encrypted files with chosen auditors
- Accept correct audit report by auditor
- Once the fixes to code were made and audit is made public the startup obtains proof of audit NFT

The auditors can:
- Accept request for audit from startup
- Access encrypted project files for verification
- Send finished audit report
- Get NFT showcasing on-chain proof that they performed an audit

It also allows the normal users to access critical information about smart contract security and help them make informed decisions about their investments for the protocol and dApps that they are using. It's because the audits are stored on Filecoin and proof of the audit is NFT on the FVM.
